Simple java projects

EnrollmentApplication is a Java GUI with a database backend that allows a student to enroll in classes from a database using a simple GUI and then have his/her name and student id stored in the database as well as what class they are in, and whether or not the student gets put on a waitlist for that class. New classes can be added to the database with an administrative version of the GUI, and those new classes will automatically be reflected in the course list for the student GUI.
